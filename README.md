# CNN-implementation-for-digit-classification
This project is basic implementation of deep neural network - CNN for digit classification

Data set consist of 70,000 digits having 28 x 28 pixels
processes :

1) Dataset import and transformations 
2) Feature engineering
3) Model creation 
4) Model implementation 
5) Model validation and tuning
